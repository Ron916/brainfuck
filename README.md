#Hello.

This repo is a work-in-progress.

Apologies for the language however this is a purely academic endeavor, intended as an exercise in web application architecture.

It is a Brainfuck Machine I created, wrapped in an over-engineered
web application.

Brainfuck:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck

"Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism.

The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing-complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.

 The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding"
