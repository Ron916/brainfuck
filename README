WP Brainfuck Machine

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck

"The brainfuck programming language is an esoteric programming language noted for its extreme minimalism. 
It is a Turing tarpit, designed to challenge and amuse programmers, and was not made to be suitable for practical use.
It was created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller."

Now you can add a brainfuck machine to your own Wordpress Install via a PlugIn!

Why would you want to do such a thing?  Who knows.

Also works as a standalone program via index.php.
